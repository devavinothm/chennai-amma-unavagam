# Plotting Amma Unavagams in Chennai

## Introduction

Amma Unavagam is a chain of budget canteens run by the Government of Tamil Nadu in India. The canteens were first established in Chennai in 2013 by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, J. Jayalalithaa. The canteens serve food at subsidised rates to the urban poor. The canteens are run by the Chennai Corporation and are open from 7 am to 10 am for breakfast and from 12 pm to 3 pm for lunch. The canteens serve a variety of dishes, including idli, pongal, sambar rice, curd rice, lemon rice, and chapati. The canteens have been a popular initiative in Chennai and have been praised for providing nutritious food at affordable prices.

## Project

In this project, we will plot the locations of Amma Unavagams in Chennai on a map. We will use the contextily library to create an map that shows the locations of the canteens. We will also use the geopy library to get the latitude and longitude of each canteen. The data for the project will be sourced from the Chennai Corporation website.

## Data

The data for the project will be sourced from the Chennai Corporation website. The website provides a list of the locations of Amma Unavagams in Chennai. We will scrape the website to get the data and then use the geopy library to get the latitude and longitude of each canteen. The data will be stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Tools

The project will be implemented in Python using the Pandas, Geopy, and Contextily libraries. We will use Pandas to read and manipulate the data, Geopy to get the latitude and longitude of each canteen, and Contextily to create the map.

## Conclusion

In this project, we will plot the locations of Amma Unavagams in Chennai on a map. The map will show the locations of the canteens and will help us understand the distribution of the canteens in the city. The project will provide a visual representation of the canteens and will help us appreciate the efforts of the Chennai Corporation in providing nutritious food at affordable prices to the urban poor.
